Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kevin, and Iâ€™m a student at the bootcamp of programming of the National University of Tres de Febrero.

Personal details: I was born on March 3rd, 1997, in General La Madrid, where I still live. I studied at Manuel Belgrano National School, and then I took a computer course.

Ever since I was little boy, Iâ€™ve been super into everything computer related. I taught myself a until I could start formal training, all thanks to my hometown, General La Madrid, which really values education. Theyâ€™re always kicking off projects to help folks skill up in various specialties.
