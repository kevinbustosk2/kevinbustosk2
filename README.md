<h2> Hi there 👋 My name is Kevin </h2>

<h3>I’m a student at the bootcamp of programming of the National University of Tres de Febrero.</h3>

<p>Personal details:</p> I was born on March 3rd, 1997, in General La Madrid, where I still live. I studied at Manuel Belgrano National School, and then I took a computer course.
Ever since I was little boy, I’ve been super into everything computer related. I taught myself a until I could start formal training, all thanks to my hometown, General La Madrid, which really values education. They’re always kicking off projects to help folks skill up in various specialties.
